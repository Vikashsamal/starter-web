India chased down the massive target of 204 with an over to spare at The Eden Park Stadium to take a 1-0 series lead. Virat Kohli and KL Rahul provided a solid foundation for the run chase with a second-wicket partnership of 99 runs after which Shreyas Iyer and Manish Pandey took the team over the line with their unbeaten 62-run stand.
